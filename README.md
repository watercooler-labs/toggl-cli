# toggl-cli

Unofficial CLI for [Toggl Track](https://toggl.com/track/) written in Rust, using the [v9 API](https://developers.track.toggl.com/docs/).

## Usage

Building the binary.

```shell
cargo build # or cargo build --release
```

Installing the binary.

### From [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/toggl)

```shell
cargo install toggl
```

### From Arch Linux aur
[![toggl-cli](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/toggl-cli?label=toggl-cli)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/toggl-cli/)
[![toggl-cli-bin](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/toggl-cli-bin?label=toggl-cli-bin)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/toggl-cli-bin/)

toggl-cli is available on the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository):
- [toggl-cli](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/toggl-cli/) (release package)
- [toggl-cli-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/toggl-cli-bin/) (binary release package)

You can install it using your [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers) of choice.

Example:
```shell
$ yay -Sy toggl-cli
```

### From source

```shell
cargo install --path .
```

> This places the release optimized binary at `~/.cargo/bin/toggl`. Make sure to add `~/.cargo/bin` to your `$PATH` so that you can run the binary from any directory.

You can invoke the binary using the `toggl` command now. Alternatively you can also run the command directly using `cargo run`

```shell
cargo run [command]


# To list the last 3 time-entries
cargo run list -n 3
```

The first command you need to run is `auth` to set up your [Toggl API token](https://support.toggl.com/en/articles/3116844-where-is-my-api-token-located).

```shell
cargo run auth [API_TOKEN] # or toggl auth [API_TOKEN]
```

The API token is stored securely in your Operating System's keychain using the [keyring](https://crates.io/crates/keyring) crate.

> **Note**: On some linux environments the `keyring` store is not persistent
> across reboots. We recommend exporting the api token as `TOGGL_API_TOKEN`
> in your shell profile. The CLI will use this environment variable if it is
> set. You don't need to run the `auth` command if you have the environment
> variable set.

## Testing

To run the unit-tests

```shell
cargo test
```

## Linting

Common lint tools

```shell
cargo fmt # Formatting the code to a unified style.

cargo clippy --fix # To automatically fix common mistakes.
```

The CI will also run the lint commands for all pull-requests.
See [pull_request.yml](.github/workflows/pull_request.yml) for more details.

## Releasing

To create a new release, first bump the package version.
We have a handy script at [pkg/autodoc.rs](pkg/autodoc.rs).
Running it with no arguments, bumps the current patch version, in `Cargo.toml`
and `Cargo.lock` files.
It also updates the help documentation in this README to match the current
version of the command.
Commit and push the updated changes and a new release will show up under the
[releases](https://github.com/watercooler-labs/toggl-cli/releases) page.
